# Renagoâ€™s Caffe Dataset

This repository contains sample point-of-sale (POS) data used throughout the guidebook *Mac-Ready Power BI: Build Dashboards Without Windows*. The dataset is based on a fictional cafÃ© in Santa Monica, modeled after real-world reporting tools used in small businesses.

## ðŸ“˜ About the Data

Although the cafÃ©â€™s POS system is a legacy solution with no API integration, it supports **daily scheduled reports** that output detailed end-of-day sales. These reports have been collected since the reopening of Renagoâ€™s Caffe after COVID-19. The files reflect item-level sales transactions for drinks, food, and modifiers.

The reporting system used was designed in the early 2000s with **print-first formatting** in mind. As a result, the reports include:
- Hard-coded **subtotals** for each date  
- Multiple **header rows**  
- Visual formatting that requires transformation to convert into a clean, tabular form

These quirks provide an excellent teaching opportunity for learning **Power Query Editor (PQE)**, where users will reshape and clean the dataset before uploading it to Power BI.

## ðŸ“Š Sample Transformation Task

Your first hands-on task will involve loading one of these files and filtering for the total number of *Latte (Hot)* drinks sold in the year 2022. Youâ€™ll begin by removing headers, deleting subtotal rows, and shaping the data into a usable tableâ€”just like professionals do.
